 Enhancing Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms

 In this project,  I aimed to develop a predictive model using linear regression to assess the quality of wine. 
 
 I began by collecting a dataset containing various wine samples along with their corresponding quality ratings.
 
 After preprocessing the data to handle any missing values and scaling the features, I split it into training and testing sets. 
 
 Next, I applied linear regression to train the model on the training data.
 
 I fine-tuned the model's parameters and evaluated its performance on the test set.
 
 The final outcome was a reliable machine learning model capable of predicting wine quality based on input features, facilitating informed decision-making for wine producers and consumers.
